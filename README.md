# Technical Documentation Project

This project aims to create a technical documentation webpage that adheres to certain requirements.

## Project Overview

The project involves building a technical documentation webpage with specific elements and functionalities. Here's a breakdown of the main tasks:

- Creating a main element (`#main-doc`) containing the main content (technical documentation).
- Dividing the main content into sections (`section` elements with a class of `main-section`), with each section focusing on a specific topic.
- Ensuring each section starts with a header element describing the topic, and assigning corresponding IDs to sections.
- Including paragraphs (`p` elements), code snippets (`code` elements), and lists (`li` items) within each section.
- Setting up a navigation bar (`nav` element with `id="navbar"`) containing links (`a` elements with class `nav-link`) to navigate to each section.
- Implementing functionality so that clicking on a navbar link takes the user to the corresponding section.
- Applying responsive design using at least one media query.
